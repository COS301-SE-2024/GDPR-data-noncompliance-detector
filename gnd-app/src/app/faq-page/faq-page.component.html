      data outside the EU and EEA areas.
    </p>
    <h3>Why is GDPR important?</h3>

      GDPR is important because it enhances the protection of personal data and

      reputation.
    </p>
    <h3>What constitutes a GDPR violation?</h3>

      A GDPR violation occurs when an organization fails to comply with any of

      collection, not protecting personal data adequately, or not providing
      individuals with their data rights.
    </p>
    <h3>How can I detect a GDPR violation?</h3>
    <p>
      Detecting a GDPR violation involves monitoring data handling practices,

      Data Protection Officer (DPO) or your organization's compliance team. They
      will conduct an investigation and take appropriate actions.
    </p>
    <h3>How do I report a GDPR violation?</h3>
